**Library Management Panel**

Hello everyone! In this project, I would like to outline what I have done in a list format:

1. To use the application, you need to enter "k1" for the username and "s1" for the password.

2. After logging in, you can add a book from any author by filling in the necessary information.

3. To update or delete a book you added, simply select the book from below and perform the desired action.

4. To lend a book to a student, you can enter the student number (you must select a book for this process).

5. To calculate the late fee that a student will pay, it is sufficient to select any date.
